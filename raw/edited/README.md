# Edited CLDF datasets as xlsx files

generated by `idspy:create_language_sheet.py()` using the naming convention `Lg_Name-Lg_ID.xlsx` (only the `Lg_ID` will be parsed). Make usage of the CLDFBench command `download` to convert them into `csv` files before making the CLDF dataset out of them. Contributors, including the original contributors, of these edited data have to be stored as `Lg_Name-Lg_ID.md` containing a markdown table of the same structure as CONTRIBUTORS.md with these three possible descriptions **author**, **data entry**, **consultant** (can be comma-separated).
